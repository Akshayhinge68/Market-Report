As the demand for innovative, immersive, and adaptive learning experiences rises, the market will need to continuously innovate to meet the evolving needs of global learners.</p><h2>Challenges and Opportunities Ahead</h2><p>While the future looks promising, challenges remain. Digital divide issues, particularly in low-income regions, pose a significant barrier to widespread adoption.
